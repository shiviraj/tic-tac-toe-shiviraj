things to modify
 --done-- Presenter's contract
 --done-- packageNames

 --done-- Board Data structure
    (Board size should be odd number)

 --done--   HumanPlayer class,
 --done--   ai Player knows board
 --done--   game constructor
 --done--   Game shouldn't know about ai HumanPlayer

    Class should be less chatty

    look all the methods acc. to board size of 3
    fix test for the board size of 3

   --partially done-- thinking of a higher data structure for board
   --done-- send size * size as board size
   --done--  move hasGameWon into game class

feature
    --done-- 1. presenting the board -
    --done-- 2. letting HumanPlayer to play move
    --done-- 3. manage HumanPlayer's turn
                 - think about iterator
    --done-- 4. winning and draw condition
    --done-- 5. Error Handling


Players -> HashMap<String Name, String Symbol>
Board -> Array of Array
